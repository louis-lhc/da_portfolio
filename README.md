As part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course, an extensive case study was conducted, accompanied by meticulous documentation within a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis involved the utilization of Python programming language, leveraging its powerful capabilities to compile disparate datasets into a unified data frame. The primary tool employed for data exploration and analysis was the Pandas Library.

To effectively communicate the findings and insights derived from the analysis, data visualizations were crafted using the matplotlib library. Moreover, to enhance the accessibility and interactivity of the results, a user-friendly dashboard was created utilizing Tableau. The dashboard provided a streamlined and intuitive means for stakeholders to engage with the findings, enabling them to effortlessly glean valuable insights from the data.
